# Copying Web Pages
This is a tutorial on how to create a static version of any webpage to serve as the front end for a CTF.

This method is used in the creation of the CWRU Student Information System (SIS) CTF.

After following this method and copying web pages, modifications can be made, and backends can be connected to allow for exploits.

## Download WebScrapBook

To copy the HTML and assets from a dynamic website, use the Firefox (install [here](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)) plugin WebScrapBook (install [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/webscrapbook/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search)).

## Take a capture of the webpage

Navigate to whatever webpage you want to copy; for this example, I will copy the SIS class list tab.

Next, open the WebScrapBook plugin (click the puzzle piece in the top left to open the plugin menu).

When opened, select `Capture Tabs (source)` and a file should be downloaded to your computer.
